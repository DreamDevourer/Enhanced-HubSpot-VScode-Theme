## Free and Open Source Theme
This theme is almost a remake of the original theme, because this was made from scratch with new theme syntax template to match current standards of new VSCode versions. Of course this theme concept and idea was made by pwilver12 and published by hatreeksbergermon, I simply updated it with a couple improvements.
